## Concept

We are taking a chosen stock and allowing for a direct comparison to the Covid-19 case numbers.

The drive to develop this application is give a user another way of observing stock affects with the changing economic landscape. 

As a US citizen I would like to see a comparison on the economy and Covid-19 levels so that I can have a better understanding of the financial impact of the pandemic. When I manipulate the “open” “high” “closing” and “date range” values. Then I am presented with data I want to see specific to the economy that I can compare with the current Covid-19 rates. I would also like to be able to receive actionable  insights through data analysis. This will allow me to thoroughly understand and insight into the correlation of the two subjects.
